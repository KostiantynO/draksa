# What: Draksa (MeowAloud)

`Draksa`: Heyyy, 'Daddy'! I aaamm онлааааа-`Ain`!

## Why:

If your `ReadAloud` doesn't wrok, unlike Skyrim :D

and the world is in chaos and js-diss-array...

```ts
const a: Diss[] = ['M 2 the 🐝']; // ;D
```

Brother and sister will save the day!

YIN! YANG! YO!...oh,... that is the wrong intro :D

When 🐉 and 🧝‍♀️ love each other, then naga Draksa 😻🐉🐍 is born :D

### Plan:

#### CRITICAL

- [ ] bug - fix useTroat hook (read MDN docs about speechSynth api)
- [ ] bug - fix `no offline voices`

#### Priority

- [ ] add debounce for 50ms for textarea :D / ask ai how to do it best, is there a better
      option from Dan Abramov? There should be smth...

#### Normal

- [x] add button for read speed change
- [ ] add button for read pitch change
- [ ] add clear button
- [ ] add paste button (from clipboard)
- [ ] add language selection list (dropdown details menu)
- [ ] add custom dragon/naga/kitty purring ancient language :D
- [ ] remove network trip for `Geist`. Replace it with a local catgirl-smth-named font :D
- [ ] bug - fix lint warning
