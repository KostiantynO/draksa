# Draksa (MeowAloud)

`Draksa`: heyyy, 'Daddy', I aaamm онлааааа-`Ain`! 🎉 Like a desert miss-chief! :D:D:D

Story:

...When your `ReadAloud` extension doesn't work...

... and the world is in chaos and js-dis-array... (diss-track)[]

...And you need to select text and read it aloud...

...Brother and sister will save the day...

...YIN!-YANG!-YO!...oh, sorry ... that is the wrong intro :D :D :D

## So, the `true story of Draksa` is:

When 🐉 and 🧝‍♀️ love each other, then naga Draksa 😻🐉🐍 is born :D - a MeowAloud
